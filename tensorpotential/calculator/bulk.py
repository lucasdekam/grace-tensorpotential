"""Evaluate a GRACE (or any ASE) calculator over many structures.

Looping a calculator over a list of ``ase.Atoms`` is the single most repeated
snippet around this package — the CLIs do it, and so does every analysis script.
The order it runs in costs time, too: every ``(n_atoms, n_neighbours)`` padded
shape the model has not seen yet triggers an XLA compile. ``TPCalculator``'s
padding managers already bound how often that happens; feeding the LARGEST
structure first bounds it further, since the widest shape is then compiled once
and every smaller structure reuses it.

``predict_structures`` is that loop, with the ordering handled internally and the
results always returned in the caller's order. It runs one structure per forward
pass; for many small structures on a GPU the batched path in
``tensorpotential.uq.feature_extraction`` is faster, but that one is
``TPCalculator``-only whereas this works with any ASE calculator.

    """Evaluate ``calc`` on every structure in ``atoms``.

    Parameters
    ----------
    atoms : iterable of ase.Atoms
        Structures to evaluate. They are **copied**; the caller's objects never
        have a calculator attached and are not modified.
    calc : ase.calculators.calculator.Calculator
        Any ASE calculator — ``TPCalculator``, ``PyGRACEFSCalculator``, ...
        A single instance is reused for every structure.
    properties : sequence of str
        Any of ``energy``, ``forces``, ``stress``.
    extra : sequence of str
        Keys read out of ``calc.results`` after evaluation — e.g. ``gamma``,
        ``atomic_sigma``, ``features`` for a UQ-enabled model. These have to be
        harvested from ``results`` rather than requested as properties because
        ``TPCalculator`` does not declare its UQ outputs in
        ``implemented_properties`` (it builds a per-instance ``extra_properties``
        list instead); once it does, they can move into ``properties``.
        A key the calculator does not provide yields ``None`` for that structure
        rather than an error, since availability depends on the model.
    optional : sequence of str
        Properties this calculator may legitimately be unable to produce, giving
        ``None`` for that structure instead of an error. Defaults to
        ``("stress",)``: a calculator that does not implement stress is not a
        failure. Only ASE's ``PropertyNotImplementedError`` is tolerated — a
        stress computation that genuinely blows up still propagates.
    sort_by_natoms : bool
        Evaluate largest-first so the biggest XLA shape compiles once. This is a
        pure performance knob — results come back in the ORDER OF ``atoms``
        either way.
    on_error : {"raise", "warn"}
        What to do when a structure fails. ``warn`` logs the first few failures
        and stores ``None`` for that structure.
    progress : callable(done, total) or None
        Called after each structure. Use for a progress bar or log line.

    Returns
    -------
    dict of str -> list
        One key per requested property and per ``extra`` key. Every list has
        ``len(atoms)`` entries, aligned with the input; failed or unavailable
        entries are ``None``.

    Examples
    --------

    >>> np.array(out["energy"])                                   # doctest: +SKIP
